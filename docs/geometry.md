# Orthogonal Tube Bank

A geometry where the tubes bank is always orthogonal to the flow around the tube bank. This can for
example be a straight tube bank in a box, or an axial involute tube bank in an annulus.

The tubes per row and number of rows are integers. However when a user inputs a tube bank length (in
the direction of the flow around the tubes), and the spacing between tubes, one of these two
